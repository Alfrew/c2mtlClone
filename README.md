# C2MTL (Clone Site)

## Description

Replica of the main page of the C2MTL website. I've recreated this page mainly for fun and to test my Front-End development skills.<br/>
During the development of this site I've refined my workflow for website development, I've further improved my JavaScript skills especially in DOM manipulations and event management.
Other than that I've also tested my css and scss skills, trying to replicate all the animations and small user interactions that you can find in the original website.
